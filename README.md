<p> I’m <b>Rochelle </b>, though most people know me as <i>"Rochelle"</i> or <i>"Elle,"</i> My passion for technology and community building has shaped my journey so far. As a third-year student at National University Baliwag, I’m pursuing a <b>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, with a focus on Mobile and Web Application.</b> This is where I sharpened my skills and developed a strong interest in mobile and web development.</p>
